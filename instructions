Okay, here’s a breakdown of the transcript, outlining the plan:

**Project Goal:** To create a system combining an MCP (likely a custom server setup) with an OLAMA model (using the Qwen 2.5 7 billion parameter model).

**Phase 1: Building a Single MCP Server**

*   **Purpose:** The initial server will be a basic, introductory server.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Provides information about the server itself – who it is and what it can do.
    *   Limited functions:
        *   Retrieving information about the server’s identity.
        *   Displaying the content of a text file (a "resource dump").

**Next Steps (Implied):**

*   The plan is to build three more MCP servers.
*   The connection between the host and these servers is a key part of the overall design.

Do you want me to elaborate on any aspect of this plan, such as:

*   Suggesting technologies for building the MCP servers?
*   Discussing how the OLAMA model might be integrated?
*   Help you brainstorm potential features for the initial MCP server?
